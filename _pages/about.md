Welcome to my blog! I'll be using this space to document my personal journey from the roots of classical AI through cutting-edge deep learning and modern production systems.. Each post will build on previous posts, diving deeper into the fundamental mathematics, classical machine learning techniques, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, and beyond. While I learn and experiment, I share detailed explanations, code snippets, and practical insights - so you can follow along and grow your own AI skill set step by step.

I've structured the curriculum so that each topic stands on its own while maintaining a natural progression: from mathematical foundations and linear models, to state-of-the-art models like Transformers and Graph Neural Networks, to the nitty-gritty details of getting ML systems into production. My aim is to clarify and demystify AI, capturing both successes and stumbles, in the hope that others can benefit from these experiences. If you're eager to learn AI at a thorough but accessible pace, you're in the right place. Let's explore AI together!
